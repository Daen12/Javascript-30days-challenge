# Javascript-30days-challenge

##Day 3 : 
- Learned that I can create properties with the suffix of 'Data'. 
- For example, <input data-sizing='px'> and when I console.log this.data, it shows 'sizing':px as a separate method.
- Also learned that I can define :root in style tag so it functions as base code. "filter: blur(var(--blur))
- Learned new event types such as 'change' and 'mousemove'.

##Day 4:
- Learned practical usage of filter(), map(), reduce(), sort()
- For reduce, we need to enter the default value(ex. {} / 0) at the end.
- Dom elements can be selected by querySelector. You can call queryselector against any existing dom element, not just 'document', to look inside of that dom element. 
- Sometimes we need to change the 'node'form into 'array' to search for elements that we want to select.
  * We can use'Array.from()' or '[...Array]'
- To find if an item includes certain strings, we use 'includes()'
- Still not sure why aLast - bLast doesn't work and aLast>bLast? 1:-1 works.
