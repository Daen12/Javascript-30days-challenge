# Javascript-30days-challenge

###day 3 : Learned that I can create properties with the suffix of 'Data'. 
For example, <input data-sizing='px'> and when I console.log this.data, it shows 'sizing':px as a separate method.
Also learned that I can define :root in style tag so it functions as base code. "filter: blur(var(--blur))
Learned new event types such as 'change' and 'mousemove'.
